0.7.0 (2018-11-16)
------------------
* Fixed a bug to ensure that shutdown event is handled correctly (`#154 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/154>`_)
  * There was a potential race condition in between when the shutdown event is emitted and the rest of the shutdown handling code.
  * This introduces an additional await to ensure that the event is emitted before proceeding.
* Added support for passing parameters as a dictionary to a Node (`#138 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/138>`_)
* Made various fixes and added tests for remappings passed to Node actions (`#137 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/137>`_)
* Added ability to pass parameter files to Node actions (`#135 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/135>`_)
