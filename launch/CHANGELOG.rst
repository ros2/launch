0.7.0 (2018-11-16)
------------------
* Fixed a bug to ensure that shutdown event is handled correctly (`#154 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/154>`_)
  * There was a potential race condition in between when the shutdown event is emitted and the rest of the shutdown handling code.
  * This introduces an additional await to ensure that the event is emitted before proceeding.
* Fixed example to always use shell to avoid inconsistency of time being a shell command or executable (`#150 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/150>`_)
* Added tests for class_tools module and fix is_a_subclass() (`#142 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/142>`_)
* Added tests for the utilities module (`#143 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/143>`_)
* Added 'handle_once' property for unregistering an EventHandler after one event (`#141 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/141>`_)
* Added UnregisterEventHandler action (`#110 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/110>`_)
* Changed LaunchService so that it returns ``1`` on caught exceptions from within launch (`#136 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/136>`_)
* Added ability to define and pass launch arguments to launch files (`#123 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/123>`_)
  * Added self descriptions for substitutions
  * Added tracebacks back to the output by default
  * Added new actions for declaring launch arguments
  * Added new method on LaunchDescription which gets all declared arguments within
  * Added ability to pass arguments when including a launch description
  * Added description for local variables used in Node action
  * Added ability to show and pass launch arguments on the command line
  * Added an accessor for the Condition of an Action

  * Signed-off-by: William Woodall <william@osrfoundation.org>

  * Signed-off-by: William Woodall <william@osrfoundation.org>

0.5.2 (2018-07-17)
------------------
* Made a change to avoid reentrancy of signal handlers (`#99 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/99>`_)
* Ignored warning for builtins A003 (`#100 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/100>`_)
* Fixed exception when launch process with environment variables (`#96 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/96>`_)
* Contributors: Shane Loretz, William Woodall, dhood

0.5.1 (2018-06-27)
------------------
* Changed the behavior when signaling SIGINT to subprocesses on Windows, where it now does SIGTERM instead, because SIGINT causes a ValueError about SIGINT being an unsupported signal number. (`#94 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/94>`_)
* Fixed a bug by avoiding reentrancy in the SIGINT signal handler. (`#92 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/92>`_)
* Various Windows fixes. (`#87 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/87>`_)
  * LaunchService.run() now returns non-0 when there are exceptions in coroutines.
  * Updated ``launch_counters.py`` example for Windows.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause mismatched asyncio loops in some futures.
  * Addressed the fact that ``signal.SIGKILL`` doesn’t exist on Windows, so emulate it in our Event.
  * Fixed an issue that resulted in spurious asyncio errors in LaunchService test.
* Contributors: William Woodall, dhood

0.5.0 (2018-06-19)
------------------
* Fixed a bug where unclosed asyncio loops caused a traceback on the terminal on exit, but only in Python 3.5 (`#85 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/85>`_)
* Changed to use variable typing in comments to support python 3.5 (`#81 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/81>`_)
* New launch API (`#74 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/74>`_)
  * See pull request for more details and links to architecture documentation and the design doc.
* Moved launch source files into launch.legacy namespace (`#73 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/73>`_)
  * This was in preparation for the new launch API.
* [for launch.legacy] fixed a flake8 warning (`#72 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/72>`_)
* [for launch.legacy] set zip_safe to avoid warning during installation (`#71 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/71>`_)
* [for launch.legacy] Fix hang on keyboard interrupt (`#69 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/69>`_)
  * When keyboard interrupt exception occurs loop.run_forever is called. But there is no loop.stop call. This causes a hang.
